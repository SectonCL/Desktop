# IMPORTANT

## What's going on?
SCLDesktop is no more. And so is **temporarily** AbstractDesk.

## What happened...
### With SCLDesktop?
SCLDesktop was about the "good old" looks. I stopped liking this idea and decided to go modern with AbstractDesk. The `latest` branch is SCLDesktop with some modern changes.
SCLDesktop needed the major rewrite, and it turned into AbstractDesk. Currently closed-source.

### With AbstractDesk?
While rewriting SCLDesktop, there was problems with theming and applications. This caused me to convert current AbstractDesk's code into a new User Interface Library.
Will be closed-source until it is usable.

## What's the future of...
### SCLDesktop?
Probably none. But i have an idea to bring some minor updates to the code. Probably wouldn't happen.

### AbstractDesk?
A big one:
* SCLDesktop will be split into UI library and AbstractDesk itself
* UI Library will be independent from AbstractDesk
* Windows will be movable and not hardcodedly-maximized
* AbstractDesk will be a Linux's Desktop Environment.

## What can i do now?
You can use `latest` branch instead of `master`: it contains some modern changes, while `master` is stable.
